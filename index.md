# Lesson on archaeology with Git

In this lesson we will demonstrate how we can find out who introduced a line of
code and when exactly or which commit broke a certain functionality.

We will learn how to quickly find a line of code, find out who introduced it,
when, and why, and how to quickly find the commit that changed a certain code
behavior.


## Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of Git.

2. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
