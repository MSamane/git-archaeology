# Lesson on archaeology with Git

In this lesson we will learn how to quickly find a line of code, find out who introduced it,
when, and why, and how to quickly find the commit that changed a certain code
behavior.


## Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of Git.
2. We build on top of [Introduction to version control with Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).
